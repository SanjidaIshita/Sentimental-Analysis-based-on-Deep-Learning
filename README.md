# Sentimental-Analysis-based-on-Deep-Learning
In this project uses the deep learning technology to analyze the sentiment of the movie
reviews in the IMDB dataset, and divide them into negative and positive categories. It is
necessary to classify movie reviews. For the user, it is a recommendation tool for movie
selection, which helps the user make a choice. For film companies, this information can be
used for marketing decisions and finding customers. This paper is introducing three neural
network models (CNN, RNN, LSTM).

Sentiment analysis is the process of retrieving information about a consumer’s
perception of a movie..By definition, sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the use of text
analysis, computational linguistics, or Natural Language processing (NLP) in order to get
semantic quantification of the studied information. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is
the analysis of people’s opinions, emotions, and attitudes from written expressions.
